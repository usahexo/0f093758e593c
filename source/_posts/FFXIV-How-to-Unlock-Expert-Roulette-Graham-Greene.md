#  FFXIV How to Unlock Expert Roulette Graham Greene

After a few weeks of playing FFXIV and leveling up, you will likely reach level 50. Upon reaching this level, you are able to participate in roulette (a game where you can potentially get very valuable rewards). There are several different kinds of roulette available in the game, but the Expert Roulette is considered to be the best.

To unlock the Expert Roulette, however, you first need to complete a series of quests. The quests are called "The Levin Conspiracy" and they are relatively easy to complete. In fact, they can all be completed by following just a few simple steps:

1) Talk to NPC Yda in Ul’dah - Steps of Nald (x:10.6 y:11.4) and accept the quest “The Levin Conspiracy” from her.

2) Travel to The Steps of Thal (x:11.8 y:8.8) and speak with NPC Alphinaud Leveilleur. Accept the quest “Agnar’s Will” from him.

3) Return to Ul’dah and speak with NPC Yda again. She will give you the item “Key of discernment” which is required for the next step.

4) Travel to Western Thanalan (x:22 y:17) and find NPC Auriana at Revenant’s Toll (x:11 y:9). Speak with her and accept the quest “In Service of Science” from her.

5) Finally, return to Ul’dah and speak with NPC Yda one last time. She will give you the item “Levin Orb” which is required for the next step.

6) Travel to Central Shroud (x:20 y:21) and find NPC Hecteyes at Bentbranch Meadows (x:13 y:18). Use the Levin Orb on him and he will give you access to the Expert Roulette area.

#  How to Unlock the Expert Roulette in FFXIV

After progressing through all the levels of roulette in Final Fantasy XIV, you may be wondering how to unlock the Expert Roulette. The good news is that it's not too difficult - all you need is a few Gil and some time.

To unlock the Expert Roulette, simply head to your nearest casino and look for the "Expert" tab. Once you're there, simply bet 1000 Gil on a single spin and voila - you'll now have access to the more challenging version of this popular casino game.

While playing in the Expert Roulette offers more lucrative rewards, it's also a lot more difficult. In order to win big, you'll need to perfect your strategy and know when to risk it all. To help get you started, we've put together a few tips that should set you on your way to becoming a pro gambler:

1) Choose Your Targets Wisely

One of the most important things to remember when playing in the Expert Roulette is that not every spin is created equal. Just because you hit a winning streak early on doesn't mean that everything is going to go your way from then on. In fact, if you're not careful, you could quickly lose all your hard-earned Gil.

Therefore, it's important to choose your targets wisely and only gamble with money that you can afford to lose. By doing this, you'll minimise your risks while still giving yourself the opportunity to make some serious profits.

2) Bet Small When You're Starting Out

When starting out in the Expert Roulette, it's important to bet small and slowly increase your bets as you become more comfortable with the game. This will help reduce your chances of losing everything right from the get-go and give you time to assess the situations and make better decisions.


3) Don't Be Afraid To Take Risks

While betting small is often a sound strategy in gambling games like roulette, there are occasions where taking a risk can pay off big time. If you feel confident about a particular spin and are willing to risk everything on it, go for it! Just make sure that you know when to quit if things don't go your way.

#  Unlocking the Expert Roulette in FFXIV

There are many different kinds of side-quests in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn (FFXIV), and one of the most popular is the expert roulette. This side-quest is only available to players who have reached level 50, and it presents a series of high-level challenges that can be completed for lucrative rewards.

The first step in unlocking the expert roulette is to speak with the NPC located in Old Gridania (X:10.5 Y:8.6). She will give you the “Key to the Expert Roulette”, which you will need in order to access the corresponding instance.

Once you have obtained the key, head to Western Thanalan (X:21.7 Y:13.8) and speak with the NPC located at the entrance to Brayflox’s Longstop (Hard). He will transport you to the expert roulette instance.

The expert roulette consists of eight high-level challenges, which can be attempted in any order. The first challenge is called “The Lord of Crags”, and it tasks players with defeating a powerful boss enemy. The other challenges are equally challenging, and include tasks such as defeating enemies while under a time limit, traversing dangerous areas without taking any damage, and more.

If you are successful in completing all eight challenges, you will be rewarded with some of the best gear in the game. The gear is scaled to your current level, so even if you are still below level 50, you can benefit from completing the expert roulette.

**First things first - what is the Expert Roulette?**

The Expert Roulette is a tougher version of the regular Roulette game in Final Fantasy XIV. It offers players greater rewards for completing its challenges, but also comes with a higher risk/reward ratio.

To access the Expert Roulette, you'll need to first complete the regular game's "Ally of Justice" roulette challenge. This is essentially a gauntlet of eight battles that must be completed in a single go, and will only be available after reaching Level 70 with at least one job.

Once that's done, return to E-4 in The Wolves' Den and speak to Halone. You'll find her standing next to Gorulga - select "Challenge Mode" from her dialogue options and she'll open up the Expert Roulette for you.

# How to play in Expert Roulette

Now that you've unlocked the Expert Roulette, it's time to learn how to play! Here are some key tips:

- The key to success in Expert Roulette is mastering your Class/Job abilities. Make sure you know all the damage types your abilities deal, as well as their optimal targets. Use this information to create effective combos and rotations.
- Make use of your Party Members! They can help mitigate damage taken, as well as add extra firepower when needed. Utilize Synergy attacks (such as Fists of Fury) whenever possible for maximum effect. - Pay attention to your Enmity! In Expert Roulette, generating too much Enmity can easily lead to death. Try not to overuse highdamage abilities if you're not confident you can handle yourself afterwards. - Use your consumables wisely! Potions, Elixirs and other consumables can give you a muchneeded edge in difficult battles. Use them at the right times and they can make all the difference.
