#  What is the name of the game?

The name of the game is "Crazy Eights". It is a card game that is usually played with two to six players.

# How do you play?

To start, each player is dealt eight cards, and the remaining cards are placed face down in the middle of the playing area. The topmost card on this pile is turned over to begin the discard pile. The goal of the game is to remove all of the cards from your hand.

On a player's turn they must play one card either from their hand or from the top of the discard pile. The card must be played according to the following rules:

  * If the card is an Ace, it can be played as either a 1 or an 11 (suit does not matter). 
* A 2 through 10 can be played as any number (face value) for that particular suit.  * A Jack (J) can be played as an 11 or 1 (again, suit does not matter), while a Queen (Q) can be played as a 12 or 2. * A King (K) can be played as a 13 or 3, and an Ace can also be used as a high card. 
* If a player doesn't have any cards left in their hand, they must draw one card from the deck and then play one. 

Once all of the cards have been removed from a player's hand, that player is out of the game. The last player left in the game wins.

#  What type of game is it?

Classical strategy board game with strong components of chance and luck.

The game is played on a square grid, with players taking turns moving pieces around the grid. The aim of the game is to capture all of your opponent's pieces, or to block their pieces so that they can't make any more moves.

There are two different types of piece in the game - warriors and magicians. Warriors can move in any direction, while magicians can only move diagonally. When a player captures a piece, they capture it by jumping over it onto an adjacent empty square.

# How do I play?

The game can be played by two people, or by two teams of two players each. The game is played in rounds, with each round consisting of a number of moves equal to the number of pieces on the board. In the first round, both players have four pieces each. In subsequent rounds, players have three pieces each, except for the final round when they have only two pieces each.

The player who starts the game is decided randomly. On a player's turn, they must either: move one of their pieces one square in any direction; or place a piece on any empty square on the board. If a player moves a piece into a position where it could take one of their opponent's pieces, they must take that piece immediately - even if it means jumping over their own pieces. If a player cannot move any of their pieces, they must forfeit their turn.

When it is not a player's turn, they may move any one of their pieces that are not currently in danger of being captured by the other player(s). Pieces that have been captured are removed from the board and cannot be moved again. The game ends when one player has either captured all of their opponent's pieces, or has blocked them so that they cannot make any more moves. The winner is then determined based on who has more pieces remaining on the board.
