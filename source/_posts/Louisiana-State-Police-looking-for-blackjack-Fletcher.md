#  No Clues In Disappearance Of Blackjack Fletcher

01/04/2018

The disappearance of 46-year-old Blackjack Fletcher has puzzled family and friends since he vanished without a trace on December 10th, 2017. Fletcher, a father of four who worked as a mechanic in the small town of Gold Hill, Oregon, had no known enemies and was not reported to be acting strange or out of character in the days leading up to his disappearance. His car was found abandoned near a hiking trail about two miles from his home, but there were no clues as to what may have happened to him.

Fletcher's loved ones have desperately tried to find any answers in his disappearance, but so far all they've been able to come up with is speculation. Some people have suggested that he may have had a heart attack or other health emergency while hiking and died suddenly, but there is no evidence to support this theory. Others believe that he may have been kidnapped or killed by someone he knew, but again there is no evidence to support this either. The most likely possibility is that Fletcher simply went for a hike and got lost, eventually succumbing to the elements or getting injured and dying somewhere in the wilderness. However, until some clues are found it will remain a mystery what happened to him.
