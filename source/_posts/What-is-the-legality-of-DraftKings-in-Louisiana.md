#  What is the legality of DraftKings in Louisiana?

Louisiana's Attorney General has announced that he will be looking into the legality of DraftKings in Louisiana. His office released a statement saying that they would be looking into whether or not the games offered by the company constitute gambling.

The company has been offering its services in the state for a little over a week, and it appears that some residents are already taking part in the contests. However, it is still unclear as to whether or not it is legal for them to do so.

Officials with DraftKings say that their games are legal, and that they are fully licensed and regulated. They also say that their contests are based on skill, and not chance.

However, many people believe that these kinds of contests constitute gambling, and that they should be illegal. There have already been lawsuits filed against the company in other states, and it is possible that Louisiana could see similar litigation in the near future.
