#  Plans for Tunica Casino Opening Revealed

Just in, the long-awaited opening of the Tunica casino is scheduled for Memorial Day weekend.

The massive complex, situated on the banks of the mighty Mississippi River, will include three hotels, a spa, and of course, a gaming floor.

The project has been in the works for years and was scaled down from its original plans in order to make it more affordable.

“This is a game changer for Tunica County,” said project spokesman Jerry Pettit. “We can finally put this sleepy town on the map.”

Local officials are equally excited about the prospects of increased tourism and revenue for their community.

“This is going to be huge for us,” said county administrator Barry Coldiron. “We can finally start to rebuild some of what we lost in the recession.”

There is still some construction work to be completed before the grand opening but all indications are that things are on track for a successful launch.

#  Punching Card Games in the Face Since 2004

The first time I ever played a card game was when I was six years old. My parents had divorced when I was young, and my dad would come to visit every other weekend. On one of those weekends, he brought his deck of cards with him and taught me how to play War.

I was instantly hooked. Not only did it give me something to do with my dad, but it was also incredibly fun. We would spend hours playing different games and trying to beat each other.

Fast-forward fourteen years, and I'm still playing card games. In fact, I've probably played more card games in the past fourteen years than in the previous six combined. And I'm not alone; card games are experiencing a resurgence in popularity.

This can be attributed to a number of factors. For one, digital devices have made it easier than ever for people to play card games. Whether you're using your phone, tablet, or computer, there's an app or software program that can help you get in on the action.

But technology isn't the only thing driving this resurgence; many people are drawn to the social nature of card games. Unlike video games or online poker, card games are face-to-face interactions that require communication and collaboration. This makes them perfect for gatherings with friends or family members.

Whatever the reason may be, it's clear that card games are back in vogue. So if you're looking for something new to try out, why not check out one of the many great card games out there? Here are just a few of my favorites:

1) War: This is the game that started it all for me. War is a simple two-player game where each player tries to remove all of their cards from play. The first player to run out of cards wins the game. It's fast-paced, easy to learn, and perfect for families or groups of friends looking for a quick game to play together.

2) Spades: Spades is another popular two-player game that's similar to War but offers more complex gameplay options. In Spades, players are dealt thirteen cards each and must form four piles (or "books") using any combination of suits. The catch is that each book must have at least one spade in it (hence the name). This makes for some very strategic gameplay as players try to block their opponent's progress while simultaneously building their own books.

3) Poker: Poker is a classic casino game that has recently seen a surge in popularity thanks to televised tournaments like the World Series of Poker. The basic premise is simple - each player tries to make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards on the table - but the strategy can be incredibly complex at higher levels of play. If you're looking for a challenging and rewarding card game, then poker is definitely worth checking out . . . even if you don't live near a casino!

#  Finally, a Casino that Understands Mississippi

When you think of Mississippi, what comes to mind? The blues? Delta sunsets? Magnolia trees in bloom? Whatever it is, it's probably not gambling. That's because Mississippi has been notoriously slow to legalize casino gambling.

But that's changing. In February 2018, the state legislature passed a bill legalizing casinos in counties that border Louisiana and Alabama. The first of these casinos is expected to open in late 2019 or early 2020.

This is great news for gambling enthusiasts in Mississippi, who have long been underserved by the casino industry. But it's also great news for the state economy. According to some estimates, the new casinos will generate more than $200 million in annual revenue.

So why did Mississippi finally legalize casino gambling? There are a few reasons.

First, there's the issue of fairness. Neighboring states Louisiana and Alabama have both had casinos for years, while Mississippi has been left out of the loop. This has created an unfair competitive disadvantage for Mississippi businesses and taxpayers.

Second, there's the issue of tourism. Casino gambling is a major tourist attraction, and Mississippi has been losing out on billions of dollars in potential revenue each year.

Third, there's the issue of jobs. The casino industry is a major employer, and Mississippi has been losing out on thousands of jobs each year.

Fourth, there's the issue of economic development. Casino gambling can be a very effective tool for economic development, and Mississippi has been lagging behind neighboring states in this regard.

Finally, there's the issue of revenuegeneration. Casino gambling generates significant amounts of revenue for state governments, and Mississippi has been missing out on this valuable source of funding.

All of these factors together have created a strong case for casino gambling in Mississippi. And with the new casinos scheduled to open soon, we're finally going to see some action on this front.
