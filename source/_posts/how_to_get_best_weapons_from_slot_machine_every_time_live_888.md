# How to Get Best Weapons from Slot Machine Every Time

In Borderlands 3, slot machines can be found in various locations throughout the game world. These slot machines can offer players a chance to win a variety of prizes, including weapons, shields, and other loot. However, the odds of winning high-quality loot can be quite low. In this article, we will provide some tips and tricks for increasing your chances of getting the best weapons from slot machines every time.

## Understanding the Slot Machine Mechanics

Before we dive into the tips, it's important to understand how slot machines work in Borderlands 3. Slot machines in Borderlands 3 have a fixed probability of winning. This probability is calculated based on the number of possible outcomes and the likelihood of each outcome occurring. In most cases, the odds of winning high-quality loot are quite low.

## Tip 1: Increase the Difficulty Level

One way to increase your chances of getting the best weapons from slot machines is to increase the difficulty level of the game. When you play on a higher difficulty level, the loot that you receive from enemies and slot machines will be of higher quality. This means that the odds of getting a high-quality weapon from a slot machine are higher on higher difficulty levels.

## Tip 2: Play the Right Slot Machine

Not all slot machines in Borderlands 3 offer the same rewards. Some slot machines are more likely to offer high-quality weapons than others. In general, the slot machines that are located in more difficult areas of the game world are more likely to offer high-quality loot. Additionally, slot machines that require a higher amount of in-game currency to use are also more likely to offer better rewards.

## Tip 3: Use the Luck Relic

The Luck Relic is an in-game item that increases your chances of getting rare loot from slot machines and enemies. This item can be found throughout the game world or purchased from vending machines. Equipping the Luck Relic while playing the slot machines will increase your chances of winning high-quality weapons and other loot.

## Tip 4: Play with Friends

Playing with friends in Borderlands 3 can increase your chances of winning high-quality loot from slot machines. When you play with friends, the loot that you receive is shared among the group. This means that if one of your friends wins a high-quality weapon from a slot machine, you will also have a chance to receive that weapon.

## Conclusion

While there is no guaranteed way to get the best weapons from slot machines every time, following these tips can help increase your chances of winning high-quality loot. By understanding the mechanics of slot machines, playing on higher difficulty levels, using the right slot machines, equipping the Luck Relic, and playing with friends, you can improve your odds of getting the best weapons in Borderlands 3.
