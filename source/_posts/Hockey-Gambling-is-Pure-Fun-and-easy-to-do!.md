#  Hockey Gambling a big hit at Pure Casino

As the NHL playoffs heat up, hockey gambling is becoming more popular at Quebec’s Pure Casino. Bettors can make their picks on who will win each game, as well as future bets on which teams will make it to the finals.

Hockey gambling has been a big hit at the casino, with over $1 million wagered so far during the playoffs. That’s a record amount for any sport at Pure Casino.

“Hockey is a very exciting sport, and our customers love betting on it,” said casino spokesperson Stéphanie Fortin. “The playoffs have been very exciting, and we expect that trend to continue during the Stanley Cup finals.”

Fortin said that while most of the action has been on single-game bets, there has also been some interest in future bets on who will win the Stanley Cup. Bettors can currently place wagers on 17 different teams, with the Las Vegas Golden Knights being the favourite at 6-1.

The Detroit Red Wings are considered longshots at 50-1, while the Buffalo Sabres are an even longer shot at 100-1.

The Canucks are currently 12-1 to win the cup, putting them just behind the Tampa Bay Lightning (10-1) and Boston Bruins (11-1).

#  NHL Betting with the Over/Under

A popular way to bet on NHL games is by predicting the total number of goals scored in a game. Bettors can choose to bet that the total number of goals scored will be over or under a certain number. The odds for this type of bet reflect the fact that there is a 50/50 chance of either outcome happening.

There are a few factors that can influence how many goals are scored in a game. One important factor is how well each team defends their own net. If one team is strong defensively and the other team is weak, it is likely that less goals will be scored. Another factor is the weather. A blizzard or very windy conditions can make it difficult for players to score goals.

One thing to keep in mind when betting on over/under totals is that the line set by the sportsbook reflects its prediction for the game. If you think that the game will have more or less than the predicted amount of goals, you can adjust your bet accordingly. For example, if you think there will be more than 5 goals scored in a game, you would bet on the over. If you think there will be fewer than 3 goals scored, you would bet on the under.

NHL betting with over/under totals can be profitable if you know what to look for. By analyzing each team’s strengths and weaknesses, as well as considering the weather conditions, you can make an informed decision about which side to bet on.
