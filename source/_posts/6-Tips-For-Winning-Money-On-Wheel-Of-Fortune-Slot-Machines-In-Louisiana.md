#  How To Win Money On Wheel Of Fortune Slot Machines In Louisiana: The Ultimate Guide

The Wheel of Fortune slot machine is one of the most popular casino games in the world. It's easy to understand, and offers plenty of chances to win big.

If you're visiting a casino in Louisiana, and want to try your luck on the Wheel of Fortune, here's what you need to know.

The Basics:

Wheel of Fortune is a five-reel slot machine, with 20 paylines. The minimum bet is $0.01 per payline, and the maximum bet is $10 per payline. So, the minimum bet is $0.20, and the maximum bet is $200.

To win the jackpot, you need to land three "Wheel of Fortune" symbols on a payline. The jackpot starts at $500,000, and increases by $5,000 every time it's not won. So, the current jackpot is over $510,000.

The Symbolism:

There are six basic symbols in Wheel of Fortune: cherries, lemons, oranges, plums, bells, and wilds (represented by a spinning wheel). All symbols pay out when two or more appear on a payline, except for the wilds which only pay out when three or more appear. The prize amounts vary depending on the symbol and how many are matched. For example: two cherry symbols payout 5x your bet amount; three bell symbols payout 50x your bet amount; etc.

How To Play:

To play Wheel of Fortune slot machine in Louisiana casinos, first choose your coin denomination (the minimum value is $0.01). Then choose how many paylines you want to play (between one and twenty). Finally, choose how much you want to bet per line (between $0.01 and $10). Click "Spin" to begin playing; or "Auto Spin" to let the game run automatically for a set number of spins (up to 100). When you're finished playing, click "Cash Out" to collect your winnings.
